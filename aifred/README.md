# AIfred powered by ZEE++

An advanced implementation of the ZEE (Zero Employee Enterprise) framework that demonstrates the next evolution of AI agents through LangChain integration.

## Overview

AIfred leverages the powerful Covalent AI Agent SDK and extends it by incorporating LangChain capabilities. While the current ZEE framework supports OpenAI, Grok, DeepSeek, and Gemini, AIfred sets the foundation for a more versatile and expandable agent architecture.

## Key Enhancements

- **LangChain Integration**: Seamlessly combines ZEE workflows with LangChain's advanced capabilities
- **Enhanced Tool Creation**: Simplified process for creating and combining complex tools
- **Flexible Agent Architecture**: Ready for future multi-modal expansions
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Improved control over agent behaviors and responses

## Future Vision

The project serves as a foundation for:
- Multi-modal interactions (text, image, audio, video)
- Enhanced reasoning capabilities
- Cross-model agent collaboration
- Dynamic tool integration

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up your environment variables in `.env`
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Run the development server with `npm run dev`

## Architecture

The project uses Next.js for the frontend and implements a sophisticated agent system that combines ZEE workflows with LangChain capabilities. This hybrid approach allows for more complex reasoning and tool utilization while maintaining the simplicity of ZEE's workflow structure.
