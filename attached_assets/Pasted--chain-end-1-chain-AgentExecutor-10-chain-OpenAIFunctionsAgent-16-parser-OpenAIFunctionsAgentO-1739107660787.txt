  ‚ä¢ agent3  Working on: In Winter's grasp, the world is hushed and white,
A crystal kingdom, silent and serene.
Yet, beneath the snow, life sleeps in the night,
Awaiting Spring's return to the scene.

With Spring, life awakens, bright and new,
Blossoms bloom, birds sing, the world is reborn.
Colours vibrant, a dazzling view,
A symphony of nature, a new dawn.

Then Summer arrives with its golden light,
Days of warmth, nights under a starry dome.
Fields of green under the sun so bright,
Nature in its abundance, a perfect home.

Autumn ends the cycle, leaves fall down,
A cascade of reds, yellows, and brown.
The world prepares again for Winter's crown,
In nature's beauty, we are all hometown.
