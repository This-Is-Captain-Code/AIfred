  ‚ä¢ agent3  Working on: As Spring's first bloom dares break winter's hold,
And life awakens, bold and new, in light.
The world is painted in hues of gold,
In the waning frost of morning's first light.

Then Summer's reign, with days so bright and long,
When the sun burns hot, and the earth is ablaze.
In the rustling leaves, hear nature's song,
As time lazily passes in a heat-filled haze.

Autumn arrives, and the leaves fall down,
In a fiery dance of red, orange, and gold.
The world prepares for winter's icy crown,
As the year grows old, and the days grow cold.

The seasons change, in an endless dance,
In nature's beauty, we find romance.
